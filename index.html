        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Lev Shchekatur and I am a Computer Scientist! I am 
            21 years old and have skills and knowledge in different fields of natural sciencies and IT- from quantum
            physics to machine learning.

        <h2>Projects</h2>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>3D Design out of Wood</h3>
            <p>This was a small univeresity project, in which I was tasked to design
                and manufacture small decorations for the Open Day. I used Fusion360 complete this task. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Writing a code for Sturmâ€“Liouville theory</h3>
            <p>Another univeresity project where I had to compute the solutions for an ordinary
                second order differential equation on Fortran. It was a math-intensive project that 
                involved elements not only from Calculus but also from Linear Algebra and Computational
                analysis. 
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>H-bridge software development</h3>
            <p> As part of my internship, I was tasked to help create an H-Bridge- a small device that
                would change the direction of the elecric current with the press of a button. It involved
                designing the exterior and welding together the components as well as writing code on
                Arduino IDE.  
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="project">
            <h3>Machine learning model based on open source data</h3>
            <p> This on-going project is an exercise to train a model to accurately predict the relationship
                between the housing prices in the USA and various extraneous features. It is still not finished though...
