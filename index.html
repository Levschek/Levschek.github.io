        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>Welcome to my portfolio! My name is Lev Shchekatur and I am a Computer Scientist! I am 
            21 years old and have skills and knowledge in different fields of natural sciencies and IT- from quantum
            physics to machine learning. Moreover, I enjoy reading books and travelling around the world! In a professional
            environment, I am keen on working in a team and take up the leading position, if it means completing the project.
        </p>
        <p>  <!--Basic text structure with paragraphs-->
            Before my current status as a student at GISMA University of Applied Sciencies, I studied physics at the Saint-Petersburg
            University of Peter-the-Great. It was a long journey that helped me understand my true passion- IT. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Putting the technical part aside, I am also a capable translator between German, Russian and English, having gained
            recognition during my school years at the annual English competition in Russia.

        <h2>My Projects</h2>
        <div class="pt">
            <h3>3D Design out of Wood</h3>
            <p>This was a small university project, in which I was tasked to design
                and manufacture small decorations for the Open Day on a laser lathe. I used Fusion360 complete this task. 
            </p>

        <div class="pt">
            <h3>Writing a code for Sturm–Liouville theory</h3>
            <p>Another univeresity project where I had to compute the solutions for an ordinary
                second order differential equation on Fortran. It was a math-intensive project that 
                involved elements not only from Calculus but also from Linear Algebra and Computational
                analysis.

            <h3>H-bridge software development</h3>
            <p> As part of my internship, I was tasked to help create an H-Bridge- a small device that
                would change the direction of the elecric current with the press of a button. It involved
                designing the exterior and welding together the components as well as writing code on
                Arduino IDE.  
            </p>

        <div class="pt">
            <h3>Machine learning model based on open source data</h3>
            <p> This on-going project is an exercise to train a model to accurately predict the relationship
                between the housing prices in the USA and various extraneous features. I use most common Python libraries
                such as Pandas, Seaborn and PyCharm.
